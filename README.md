# django_portfolio

## Part 1 - Starting the Project
In this series we’ll be creating a web application with Django. In particular, we’ll be creating a Portfolio app where the owner can showcase their work - projects, books, articles, graphics, videos or whatever else they created.

## Part 2 - The Structure of the Project
ln this part we’ll create a basic structure of the project, its skeleton. Our app is going to consist of a lot of different elements. In particular, we’ll have models, views and templates. We’ll also have settings and paths in their own files. We’re going to take care of them step by step, but in this part we’ll start with something bigger, an application.

## Part 3 - The Models
Now it’s time to create the models. In Django, models are just Python classes that represent the data. Each model defines its structure in such a way as to be understood by the underlying database. This means it defines the field types and constraints like maximum size, default values, etc., so that the database knows how to store the data.
